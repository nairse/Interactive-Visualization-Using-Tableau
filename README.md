# Interactive-Visualization-Using-Tableau
This is the second of the two projects that we did as part of the course curriculum at the University. We wanted to tell a story about how happy (or sad) the people around the world were. And we wanted to put in a good deal of interactivity to it. This repository contains the tableau file of the storypoint visualization that we created as a group.
